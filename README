This script takes an export file from KeePassX and produces a stripped-down
CSV file, which can then be imported into a spreadsheet or something and
printed.  This is handy for stashing a password list in the fire safe...
just in case.

More information on KeePassX:
http://www.keepassx.org/

To export the necessary file:
File -> Export to... -> KeePassX XML File
Put the file some place temporary, then fire up this script:
$ keepassx2csv frubble.xml > frubble.csv

The produced file is of the format:
"Group","Title","Username","Password"

You can then do what you want with it.  WARNING: You're gonna wanna delete
this file pretty danged well when you're done with it.

Any questions -> rtucker@gmail.com
